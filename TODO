- Restrict import lists
- Integrate other SMT solvers
   - Candidates:
      - CVC3 (http://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvc3/)
      - Boolector (http://fmv.jku.at/boolector/)
      - STP (http://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover/)
      - MathSat (http://mathsat4.disi.unitn.it/)
      - Z3 (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/)
   - Potential issues (as of 2011 January):
      - MathSat is not open-source
      - Z3 is Windows only
- Support uninterpreted functions
- Support blasting specifications to generate AIGs
      - Potentially integrate with ABC (http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/)
- Support for non-BV logics? LIA?
- Documentation
