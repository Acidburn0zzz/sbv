SBV: Symbolic Bit Vectors in Haskell
====================================

Express properties about bit-precise Haskell programs and automatically prove
them using SMT solvers.

        $ ghci
        Prelude> :m Data.SBV
        Prelude> :set -XScopedTypeVariables
        Prelude Data.SBV> prove $ \(x::SWord8) -> x `shiftL` 2 .== x*4
        Q.E.D.
        Prelude Data.SBV> prove $ \(x::SWord8) -> x `shiftL` 2 .== x
        Falsifiable. Counter-example:
          s0 = 128 :: [8U]

The function `prove` (and its friends `sat`, `allSat`) has types of the form:
    
        prove :: (Provable a) => a -> IO ThmResult

where the class `Provable` has instances for predicates of arbitrary arity that can be formed
as regular Haskell functions over symbolic signed and unsigned bit-vectors.

Overview
========
The Haskell sbv library provides support for dealing with Symbolic Bit Vectors
in Haskell. It introduces the types:

  - `SBool`: symbolic booleans
  - `SWord8`, `SWord16`, `SWord32`, `SWord64`: Symbolic counterparts of Words (unsigned)
  - `SInt8`,  `SInt16`,  `SInt32`,  `SInt64`: Symbolic counterparts of Ints (signed)
  - Arrays of symbolic values

The user can construct ordinary Haskell programs using these types, which behave
very similar to their concrete counterparts. However, the predicates (i.e., functions
that return SBool) built out of these types can be:

  - proven correct via an external SMT solver (the `prove` function)
  - checked for satisfiability (the `sat` and `allSat` functions)
  - quick-checked

If a predicate is not valid, the `prove` function will return a counterexample: An 
assignment to inputs such that the predicate fails. For a satisfiability
check, the `sat` function will return a satisfying assignment, if
there is one. The `allSat` function returns all satisfying assignments, lazily.

The library communicates with SMT solvers via the SMT-Lib interface: 
[http://goedel.cs.uiowa.edu/smtlib/](http://goedel.cs.uiowa.edu/smtlib/)

While the library is designed to work with any SMT-Lib compliant SMT-solver,
solver specific support is required for parsing counter-example/model data since
there is currently no agreed upon format for getting models from arbitrary SMT
solvers. (The SMT-Lib2 initiative will potentially address this issue in the
future, at which point the sbv library can be generalized as well.) Currently, we
only support the Yices SMT solver from SRI as far as the counter-example
and model generation support is concerned:
[http://yices.csl.sri.com/](http://yices.csl.sri.com/) However, other solvers can
be hooked up with relative ease.

You **should** download and install Yices on your machine, and make sure the
"yices" executable is in your path before using the sbv library, as it is the
current default solver.

Examples
=========
Please see the files under the
[Examples](http://github.com/LeventErkok/sbv/tree/master/Data/SBV/Examples)
directory for a number of interesting applications and use cases. Amongst others,
it contains solvers for Sudoku and N-Queens puzzles as mandatory SMT solver examples in
the Puzzles directory.

Installation
============
The sbv library is cabalized. Assuming you have cabal/ghc installed, it should merely
be a matter of running cabal. Please see the INSTALL file for installation details.
