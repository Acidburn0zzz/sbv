The sbv library can be installed simply by issuing cabal install.

Once the installation is done, you will get the Data.SBV library.
The installation will also put a binary named

     SBVUnitTests

in your .cabal/bin directory (or wherever you installed it.) It's
highly recommended that you run this program to ensure everything
is working correctly. In particular, you will first need to install
Yices, the default SMT solver used by sbv, from SRI. (You can get it
from http://yices.csl.sri.com/.) Please make sure that the "yices"
executable is in your path.
